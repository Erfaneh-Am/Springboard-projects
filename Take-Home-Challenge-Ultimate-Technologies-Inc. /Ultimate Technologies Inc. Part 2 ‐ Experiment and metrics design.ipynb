    "The key measure of success for the experiment in encouraging driver partners to serve both cities would be the increase in the number of trips made by driver partners crossing the toll bridge between Gotham and Metropolis. \n",
    "\n",
    "By tracking the number of trips made by driver partners crossing the toll bridge, we can directly measure the extent to which they are venturing into the neighboring city. An increase in the number of cross-bridge trips would indicate that driver partners are willing to serve both cities, as they are taking advantage of the toll reimbursement offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encouraging driver partners to operate in both cities can enhance operational efficiency by reducing wait times for passengers and increasing the availability of rides. If more driver partners are willing to cross the toll bridge, it can lead to a better distribution of drivers across the two cities, minimizing passenger wait times and improving overall service quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful experiment would result in increased revenue for driver partners as they expand their customer base to include both cities. By serving customers in both Gotham and Metropolis, driver partners can maximize their utilization and earnings potential. Therefore, monitoring the number of cross-bridge trips would provide insights into the revenue growth and utilization of driver partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of the experiment should also be evaluated based on customer satisfaction. If driver partners are available in both cities, it can lead to faster response times, shorter wait times, and increased convenience for passengers. Assessing customer feedback and ratings during and after the experiment can provide valuable insights into whether the initiative is meeting customer expectations."

If the p-value is below the predetermined significance level (e.g., 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the number of cross-bridge trips between the experimental and control groups."

    "If the results indicate a significant increase in the number of cross-bridge trips in the experimental group, it would suggest that the toll reimbursement program has effectively encouraged driver partners to serve both cities. In such a case, I would recommend scaling up the toll reimbursement initiative to a larger group of driver partners, considering the positive impact on driver availability, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction."
